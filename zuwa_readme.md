### üî≠ Projects

#### [Predicting CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/CO2-emissions-ML-project) 
Built visualizations and model to predict CO2 emissions for any place of interest. Performed EDA and machine learning to build model. Visualizations and dashboard in Tableau. Final XGBoost model with 98% R-squared with code available to deploy, using Flask, on any local machine. This project is anticipated to have expected use cases in academia for research purposes and also in environmental monitoring.

#### [Supervised ML for Diabetes Diagnosis](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/lhl-ml-supervised-learning)
Predicting presence of diabetes in patients from health metrics, utilizing the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases dataset. Key steps included Exploratory Data Analysis, data preprocessing for inconsistencies, and oversampling for balance. Models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest were trained and evaluated, with Logistic Regression emerging as effective for its simplicity and interpretability. The project underscores the significance of thorough data preparation in machine learning, offering an approach that balances ease of use and predictive accuracy.

#### [Wildlife Strikes Visualization with Tableau](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/lhl-tableau-project)
Analyzed 2015 FAA Wildlife Strikes data, revealing key trends like most strikes occurring during the day and in summer, predominantly involving birds. The analysis, focusing on state-wise strike distribution and financial impacts, identified coastal states as hotspots. Future goals include integrating flight path data to deepen the understanding of strike patterns.

#### [Unsupervised ML for Wholesale Analysis](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/lhl-ml-unsupervised-learning) 
Analyzed a wholesale distributor's client purchasing behaviors. Utilizing KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the study revealed two distinct customer groups and multi-level purchasing patterns. Key findings include strong correlations between certain product categories and feature redundancy highlighted by PCA. These insights aid in developing targeted marketing and inventory strategies.

#### [Statistical Modelling for Bike Sharing project](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/lhl-statistical-modelling-project)
Analyzed the relationship between bike availability and nearby Points of Interest (POIs) using CityBikes, Yelp, and Foursquare APIs, with a focus on the city of Dublin, Ireland. The process involved merging bike station data with POIs information, and building an OLS regression model using the statsmodel API in Python. Key findings suggested that POI counts from Yelp and Foursquare had limited statistical significance in predicting bike availability. Yelp API outperformed Foursquare in data detail and coverage. Challenges included API request limits and data processing time. Future goals include the use of a different types of models and inclusion of more categories in API request for POIs to enrich dataset.

#### [SQL Ecommerce Data Analysis](https://github.com/zuwa-oj/lhl-sql-project) 
Focused on ETL using PG Admin and EDA with emphasis on data cleaning, transformation and analysis for extraction of insights using advanced SQL queries. The project involved preliminary data examination, importing to pgAdmin, data cleansing, and extracting insights through SQL queries. Key findings included identifying the USA as the top revenue-generating country, and observing a pattern where the highest performing product category was the most popular across most of the cities and countries.
